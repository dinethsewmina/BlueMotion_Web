# 🌊 Point Absorber Wave Energy Simulation System

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **web-based simulation platform** for a *point absorber wave energy converter*. It demonstrates how ocean wave motion can be converted into electrical energy using a **spring-based mechanical system**.

The system consists of:

* ⚙️ A **Spring Boot backend** for physics-based calculations
* 💻 A **React frontend** for user interaction and visualization

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Simulate wave energy conversion using a spring mechanism
* Allow users to input wave and system parameters
* Calculate force and estimated power output
* Provide a foundation for future real-time and graphical simulations

## 🧠 System Concept

The point absorber works by converting vertical wave motion into mechanical energy using a spring system.

### Hooke’s Law:

[
F = kx
]

### Power Estimation:

[
P = F \cdot v
]

Where:

* ( k ) = spring constant
* ( x ) = displacement
* ( v ) = velocity
